# End-to-End Valorant Analytics

## Description
This project presents an end-to-end data analytics solution built around a Valorant gameplay dataset. The workflow covers every stage of the data lifecycle — from data cleaning and feature engineering to statistical analysis and cloud-based integration using Snowflake. The processed data is then visualized in Power BI, creating interactive dashboards that provide valuable insights into player performance, weapon usage, and match outcomes. This project demonstrates how modern data engineering and business intelligence tools can transform raw gaming data into actionable insights.
